Music Player

This project is a music folder. The UI displays an album artwork, the title of the current song on display and the artist of the song. It displays the current time of the song being played, the total duration of the song, a "play" button, a "previous" button and a "next" button.

Core Functionalities

The "play" button starts a song when it is clicked, and the current time increases when the song is being played. And the song pauses when it is clicked again. The current song changes to the next one when the "next" button is clicked and takes it back when the "previous" button is clicked. The "next" button can also be used to loop through the songs indefinitely, while the "previous" button can also be used to go back through the songs.
